# advanced-search-project
There are multiple files and a user is needing to find a name in a specific file by searching through a specific file.
This code will search through search through the file by splitting it in half and deciding if the name is in the 
lower half or the higher half of the file. Once decided, then it will loop again and again, cutting the file by half until the name is found or not found in the file.
